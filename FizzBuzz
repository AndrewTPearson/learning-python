# A simple program which counts and prints the numbers from 1 to a defined maximum - 25 by default - and, for two numbers
# designated "fizz" and "buzz" (set to 3 and 5 respectively by default), replaces all multiples of these numbers with "Fizz",
# "Buzz", or, for numbers which are multiples of both, "Fizzbuzz".

x=1
fizz=3
buzz=5
endpoint=25

while(x<=endpoint):
    if(x%fizz==0):
       if(x%buzz==0):
           print("Fizzbuzz")
       else:
           print("Fizz")
    else:
        if(x%buzz==0):
            print("Buzz")
