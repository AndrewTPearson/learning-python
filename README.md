# learning-python
I am a UK civil servant, currently learning to code with a view to moving to working in tech.
I grew up in Birmingham and currently live in London. I previously lived in Manchester, where I gained a BA(Hons) in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics (PPE), and Budapest, where I gained an MA in Philosophy from Central European University.
My interests include economic and commercial history; astronomy; and classical music (I play the piano and the cello).
